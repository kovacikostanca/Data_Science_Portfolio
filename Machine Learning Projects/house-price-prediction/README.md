## Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices based on various socioeconomic and structural property features.  
It demonstrates fundamental concepts in regression analysis, model evaluation, and ML best practices.

The pipeline highlights:

- **Linear Regression** as a baseline model.  
- **Polynomial Regression** with degrees 2, 3, and 4.  
- **Bias–variance tradeoff analysis** using residuals and R² metrics.  
- **Coefficient stability evaluation** via bootstrapping.  
- **Predictions on unseen housing data**.

## Methods

### 1. Linear Regression

- **Train/Test Split:** 80/20  
- **Metrics:** R², MSE, RMSE  

**Performance:**

| Metric | Training | Testing |
|--------|----------|---------|
| R²     | 0.731    | 0.749   |
| MSE    | 25.906   | 20.392  |
| RMSE   | 5.090    | 4.516   |

**Feature Impact:**

| Feature               | Coefficient | Interpretation                              |
|-----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Rooms                 | +3.5       | Each additional room increases price       |
| Age                   | +0.0026    | Older houses slightly increase price       |
| Distance              | -1.38      | Further from employment lowers price       |
| Accessibility         | +0.26      | Better access slightly increases price     |
| Tax                   | -0.011     | Higher taxes slightly reduce price         |
| DisadvantagedPosition | -0.64      | Houses in disadvantaged areas are cheaper |
| Crime                 | -0.124     | Higher crime lowers prices                 |
| NitricOxides          | -16.6      | Pollution significantly lowers prices      |
| PupilTeacher          | -1.09      | Poor school quality reduces price          |
| Residential           | +0.04      | Higher residential area slightly increases price |
| NonRetail             | +0.073     | More non-retail areas slightly increase price |

> Linear regression provides a solid baseline with interpretable coefficients.

### 2. Polynomial Regression

Tested polynomial degrees: 2, 3, 4.  

**Performance:**

| Degree | R² (Train/Test) | RMSE (Test) | Verdict            |
|--------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| 2      | 0.920 / 0.872  | 3.22        | Best fit          |
| 3      | 1.000 / -38622 | 1771.05     | Overfit           |
| 4      | 1.000 / -658   | 231.44      | Overfit           |

**Takeaways:**

- Degree 2 polynomial achieves **optimal bias-variance tradeoff**.  
- Degrees 3 and 4 severely overfit, showing **high variance**.  
- Coefficient stability via **bootstrapping** confirms degree 2 as reliable.

### 3. Bias–Variance Analysis

| Model                  | Bias | Variance | Comment                           |
|------------------------|------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Linear Regression      | Low  | Moderate | Solid baseline                   |
| Polynomial Degree 2    | Low  | Low      | Optimal tradeoff                 |
| Polynomial Degrees 3-4 | Low  | Very High| Overfitting, unstable coefficients |

### 4. Predictions on Unseen Data

Predictions generated for new housing records (`house_unseen.csv`):

| Rooms | Age  | Distance | Tax | Predicted Price |
|-------|------|----------|-----|----------------|
| 6.44  | 8.9  | 7.39     | 330 | 25.85          |
| 7.87  | 32.0 | 5.65     | 255 | 41.06          |
| 6.40  | 100  | 1.64     | 666 | 17.24          |

## Key Insights

- **Polynomial Degree 2** gives best tradeoff between bias and variance.  
- **Linear Regression** is interpretable: more rooms → higher price, more crime → lower price.  
- Higher-degree polynomials overfit, highlighting the **bias–variance tradeoff**.  
- Most impactful features: **Rooms, Nitric Oxides, Crime, Distance**.  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Future Work

- Include additional features: location, amenities, property age.  
- Explore advanced models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks.  
- Deploy a web app for real-time housing predictions.
