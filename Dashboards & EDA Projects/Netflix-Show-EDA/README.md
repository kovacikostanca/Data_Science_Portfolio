# Project Workflow

This project follows a professional data analytics pipeline:

---

## 1️⃣ Data Inspection

Initial exploration included:

- Checking dataset shape
- Reviewing column types
- Identifying missing values
- Understanding overall structure

Example:

```python
df.shape
df.info()
df.head()
df.isnull().sum()
```

---

## 2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Cleaning steps included:

- Handling missing values
- Converting date formats
- Standardizing columns
- Removing inconsistencies

Example:

```python
df['date_added'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_added'])
df['year_added'] = df['date_added'].dt.year
```

---

## 3️⃣ Feature Engineering

New features were created to enhance analysis:

Examples:

- year_added
- content_age
- duration categories
- genre grouping

Purpose: Enable deeper insights and trend discovery.
